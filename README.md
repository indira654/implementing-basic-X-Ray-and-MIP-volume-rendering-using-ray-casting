# implementing-basic-X-Ray-and-MIP-volume-rendering-using-ray-casting
This project implements X-Ray and MIP rendering using ray casting to visualize 3D .vol datasets like ctHead.vol. Built with FLTK, it offers interactive features like rotation, scaling, and orthographic projections. X-Ray sums voxel intensities, while MIP highlights the highest, aiding scientific and medical exploration.
